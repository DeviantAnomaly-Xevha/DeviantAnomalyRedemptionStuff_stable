Built for tModLoader Alpha 1.4-stable.
If you use 1.4-preview and have issues, you know why.

<<THIS IS NOT THE MOD OF REDEMPTION!!>>
The actual Redemption mod is not currently available through the mod browser, but you can acquire it in its current work-in-progress state by checking Discord.
For Steam, here's your link: https://discord.gg/J25aSxCadz
In-game, please click the Homepage button down below.
Note that it's being worked on in the preview branch,
so it may not build properly if it's been updated.



This is a small mod containing just a few items:
1) various vanity parts, mostly Xenomite-based,
2) a "Xenomite Crystal Bomb" weapon
(damage, DoTs, and projectile-reflecting crystal pillars)
3) a "Xenomite Buster" weapon
(damage, DoTs, chargeable, based on Mega Man X)
4) walls crafted from regular Xenomite Shards
(darkened Xenomite Shard tile edit, in safe and unsafe types)
5)decorative laboratory laser tiles, in green and red colors
(crafted with Laboratory Panels and gemspark blocks)
6) accessories crafted from the primary vanity set parts
(Xenomite immunity, upgraded with HEV suit (WIP),
or poison/acid venom immunity without Redemption)

The weapons can be upgraded as you progress.
With Redemption, they apply Redemption's Xenomite debuffs.
Without, they apply Poisoned, with a chance of Acid Venom.

Also, you can also craft tombstones at a heavy workbench.


This was created mainly for myself, but I hope you like it.
